# Inconsistent Dimensions in React Native on Android

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where the `Dimensions` API returns inconsistent or incorrect dimensions, particularly on Android devices. The problem is often related to asynchronous updates, leading to components rendering with incorrect sizes before the dimensions are fully available.

## Problem

The `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` methods may return inaccurate screen dimensions, resulting in misaligned elements, clipped content, or other visual glitches.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `useEffect` hook to ensure the dimensions are retrieved only after the component has mounted and to re-render the component when the dimensions change.  This ensures that layout calculations are based on the correct and up-to-date screen dimensions.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd inconsistent-dimensions`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Run the app: `npx react-native run-android`
